# Opportunity Intelligence Skill

## Purpose
This skill enables GTM professionals to research and pursue W2 employment or freelance/agency opportunities by combining account-level and contact-level intelligence. It focuses on identifying hiring signals, decoding what positions signal about company needs, and crafting quick-win deliverables that demonstrate immediate value.

## Core Framework: The Reverse GTM Stack

Traditional GTM helps companies find customers. This skill helps **you** find employers/clients by treating companies as "accounts" and hiring managers as "contacts."

## Account-Level Research

### Hiring Signal Analysis

Job postings are the most transparent signal of company priorities. Decode them systematically:

#### Signal Categories

| Signal Type | What to Look For | What It Means |
|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Role Creation** | "First hire for this function" | Building capability from scratch - high influence opportunity |
| **Role Expansion** | Multiple similar roles | Scaling what works - need process/systems |
| **Role Replacement** | Urgent timeline, specific skills | Something broke - quick wins valued |
| **Seniority Level** | IC vs Manager vs Director | Budget level and decision complexity |
| **Tech Stack Listed** | Specific tools mentioned | Integration/migration opportunities |
| **Pain Language** | "Fast-paced", "wear many hats" | Under-resourced, need efficiency |

#### Job Description Decoder

```markdown
## JD Analysis Template

**Role**: [Title]
**Company**: [Name]
**Source**: [LinkedIn/Greenhouse/etc.]

### Surface Signals
- Seniority level:
- Team size mentioned:
- Reporting structure:
- Tech stack required:
- Industry experience wanted:

### Subsurface Signals
- Why does this role exist now? (Growth/replacement/new initiative)
- What outcomes are they measuring? (Pipeline, revenue, efficiency)
- What's the implicit gap? (What skill combo is hard to find)
- Budget signals: (Salary range, equity, contractor openness)

### Opportunity Assessment
- Fit score (1-10):
- Unique value I bring:
- Quick win I can offer:
- Competition level: (# applicants if visible)
```

### Company Growth Signals

Research these indicators to understand company trajectory:

| Signal | Source | Interpretation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Funding round** | Crunchbase, TechCrunch | Budget unlocked, pressure to scale |
| **Headcount growth** | LinkedIn, Glassdoor | Which departments growing fastest |
| **New leadership** | LinkedIn, press releases | New priorities, open to change |
| **Product launches** | Product Hunt, press | GTM motion needed |
| **Geographic expansion** | Job locations, press | Territory/localization needs |
| **M&A activity** | News, SEC filings | Integration challenges |
| **Tech stack changes** | BuiltWith, job posts | Migration/implementation needs |

### Tech Stack Gap Analysis

For GTM roles, analyze their current stack vs. needs:

```markdown
## Tech Stack Assessment

### Current Stack (from BuiltWith, job posts, case studies)
- CRM:
- Marketing Automation:
- Sales Engagement:
- Data Enrichment:
- Analytics:
- Integrations:

### Stack Gaps (what they need but don't have)
- Missing:
- Underutilized:
- Poorly integrated:

### Quick Win Opportunities
Based on stack analysis, I can immediately help with:
1.
2.
3.

│  • Cross-functional     │  • Executive assistants               │
└─────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### LinkedIn Deep Research

For each key contact, gather:

```markdown
## Contact Profile: [Name]

### Professional Context
- Current role + tenure:
- Career trajectory: (Where did they come from? Where going?)
- Skills endorsed: (What do they want to be known for?)
- Recommendations given/received: (Values they express)

### Content Analysis (Last 90 days)
- Topics they post about:
- Content they engage with:
- Tone/style:
- Pain points mentioned:
- Wins celebrated:

### Network Intelligence
- Mutual connections:
- Companies they follow:
- Groups/communities:
- Influencers they engage:

### Personalization Hooks
- Shared experiences:
- Shared opinions:
- Conversation starters:
```

### Contact Pain Point Detection

Listen for these signals in their content/activity:

| Pain Signal | Example Language | Your Response |
|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Data quality** | "CRM is a mess", "bad data" | Offer enrichment/hygiene quick win |
| **Tool frustration** | "This integration is killing me" | Offer workflow optimization |
| **Team scaling** | "Hiring is hard", "onboarding" | Offer process documentation |
| **Attribution** | "Can't prove ROI", "reporting" | Offer attribution framework |
| **Velocity** | "Pipeline is slow", "stuck deals" | Offer signal-based prioritization |
| **Volume** | "Not enough leads", "top of funnel" | Offer enrichment/prospecting build |

---

## Signal Synthesis Framework

### The "Why Now" Analysis

Combine account and contact signals to understand timing:

```markdown
## Why Now Analysis: [Company]

### Company Momentum
- Growth stage: (Early/Growth/Scale/Mature)
- Recent trigger events:
- Competitive pressure:
- Budget cycle timing:

### Role Urgency
- How long has role been open?
- Reposted? Multiple similar roles?
- Hiring manager's tenure (new = more open to outside help)
- Team pain level: (Inferred from content/reviews)

### Your Timing
- Why you're right for this moment:
- What would delay decision:
- Urgency I can create:
```

### Opportunity Scoring Model

Rate opportunities to prioritize outreach:

| Factor | Weight | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Fit** - Role matches my skills | 25% | | |
| **Signal Strength** - Clear pain I solve | 20% | | |
| **Access** - Path to decision maker | 15% | | |
| **Timing** - Urgency indicators | 15% | | |
| **Value Alignment** - Culture/mission fit | 10% | | |
| **Economics** - Comp/budget alignment | 10% | | |
| **Competition** - Applicant density | 5% | | |
| **TOTAL** | 100% | | |

**Scoring Guide:**
- 4.0+ : High priority, personalized outreach
- 3.0-3.9 : Medium priority, semi-personalized
- Below 3.0 : Low priority or pass

## Deep Research with Firecrawl

Firecrawl enables deeper research than standard enrichment APIs by scraping and extracting structured data from websites. Use it to get intelligence that Clay's built-in providers can't reach.

### When to Use Firecrawl vs. Standard Enrichment

| Use Case | Standard Enrichment | Firecrawl |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| Basic firmographics | ✅ Faster, cheaper | Overkill |
| Job descriptions | ✅ LinkedIn/Indeed APIs | ✅ Career page scraping for full context |
| Company "About" page | ❌ Limited | ✅ Full narrative extraction |
| Blog/content analysis | ❌ Not available | ✅ Recent posts, thought leadership |
| Case studies | ❌ Not available | ✅ Customer wins, use cases |
| Pricing pages | ❌ Not available | ✅ Business model signals |
| Team pages | ❌ Limited | ✅ Org structure, team size |
| News/press releases | Partial | ✅ Full archive |

### Firecrawl Scrape Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Career Page Deep Dive

Scrape full job descriptions from company career pages (richer than job board summaries):

```javascript
// Firecrawl API call via Clay HTTP enrichment or Make
{
  "url": "https://company.com/careers",
  "formats": ["markdown", "extract"],
  "extract": {
    "schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "open_roles": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "title": { "type": "string" },
              "department": { "type": "string" },
              "location": { "type": "string" },
              "description_summary": { "type": "string" },
              "requirements": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } },

              "signals": { "type": "string", "description": "What this role signals about company priorities" }
            }
          }
        },
        "hiring_velocity": { "type": "string", "description": "How aggressively are they hiring?" },
        "team_growth_areas": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Pattern 2: Company Narrative Extraction

Pull the "About" page for mission, values, and positioning:

```javascript
{
  "url": "https://company.com/about",
  "formats": ["extract"],
  "extract": {
    "schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "mission_statement": { "type": "string" },
        "company_values": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } },
        "founding_story": { "type": "string" },
        "key_differentiators": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } },
        "target_customers": { "type": "string" },
        "company_stage": { "type": "string", "description": "startup/growth/enterprise based on language" },
        "culture_signals": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Pattern 3: Content/Blog Analysis

Analyze recent content for thought leadership and priorities:

```javascript
{
  "url": "https://company.com/blog",
  "formats": ["extract"],
  "extract": {
    "schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "recent_topics": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": { "type": "string" },
          "description": "Main themes from last 5-10 posts"
        },
        "content_frequency": { "type": "string" },
        "thought_leadership_areas": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } },
        "product_announcements": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } },
        "pain_points_addressed": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } },
        "content_quality": { "type": "string", "description": "high/medium/low based on depth and originality" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Pattern 4: Case Study Mining

Extract customer wins and use cases:

```javascript
{
  "url": "https://company.com/customers",
  "formats": ["extract"],
  "extract": {
    "schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "featured_customers": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "company_name": { "type": "string" },
              "industry": { "type": "string" },
              "use_case": { "type": "string" },
              "results_claimed": { "type": "string" }
            }
          }
        },
        "industries_served": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } },
        "company_sizes_served": { "type": "string" },
        "value_propositions": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Firecrawl + Clay Integration

#### Secrets Configuration

API keys are stored in GitHub repository secrets. Reference them in your workflows:

| Secret Name | Used In | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` | Clay HTTP, Make/n8n | Firecrawl API authentication |

#### Option 1: Clay HTTP Enrichment

Use Clay's HTTP enrichment column to call Firecrawl API directly:

```
URL: https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape
Method: POST
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY }}
  Content-Type: application/json
Body: {
  "url": "{{company_website}}/careers",
  "formats": ["extract"],
  "extract": { ... schema ... }
}
```

**Note:** In Clay, store your API key in Clay's built-in secrets manager (Settings → API Keys) and reference it in HTTP enrichment columns.

#### Option 2: Make/n8n Middleware

For complex scraping workflows, store the secret in your automation platform:

**Make.com:**
1. Go to your scenario → Connections
2. Create a new HTTP connection with header auth
3. Use `Bearer ${{ secrets.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY }}` from your Make vault

**n8n:**
1. Create credentials of type "Header Auth"
2. Name: `Authorization`, Value: `Bearer <your-key>`
3. Reference in HTTP Request nodes

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  Clay       │────▶│  Webhook    │────▶│  Firecrawl  │────▶│  Clay       │
│  (trigger)  │     │  (Make/n8n) │     │  (scrape)   │     │  (update)   │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

#### Option 3: GitHub Actions (for batch research)

For automated research runs, use GitHub Actions with repository secrets:

```yaml
name: Company Research Batch
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 8 * * 1-5'  # Weekdays at 8am
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  research:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Firecrawl research
        env:
          FIRECRAWL_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY }}
        run: |
          # Your research script here
          curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIRECRAWL_API_KEY" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"url": "https://target-company.com/careers", "formats": ["extract"]}'
```

### Firecrawl Research Prompts

#### Prompt: Company Deep Dive

Use this with Firecrawl's crawl endpoint to analyze multiple pages:

```
Crawl and analyze {company_domain} to build a comprehensive research profile:

PAGES TO ANALYZE:
- Homepage: What's their core value proposition?
- About: Company story, mission, values, team size
- Careers: Open roles, hiring velocity, growth areas
- Blog (last 10 posts): Topics, thought leadership, product updates
- Customers/Case Studies: Who they serve, results they deliver

EXTRACT AND SYNTHESIZE:
1. Company Stage & Trajectory
   - Are they early/growth/mature?
   - What's their growth velocity?
   - Where are they investing?

2. GTM Motion
   - Who's their ICP?
   - How do they position?
   - What's their content strategy?

3. Pain Point Signals
   - What are they trying to solve based on hiring?
   - What gaps exist based on content/case studies?
   - What's missing from their GTM stack?

4. Opportunity Assessment
   - What value could I add immediately?
   - What would a quick win look like?
   - Who should I reach out to?
```

#### Prompt: Competitive Intelligence

```
Analyze {company_domain} compared to {competitor_domain}:

1. POSITIONING DIFFERENCES
   - How do they each describe their solution?
   - What unique claims does each make?
   - Where do they overlap?

2. TARGET MARKET DIFFERENCES
   - Who does each one feature as customers?
   - What industries/sizes do they emphasize?
   - What use cases do they highlight?

3. CONTENT STRATEGY
   - What topics does each focus on?
   - Who's more active/sophisticated?
   - What gaps exist?

4. HIRING SIGNALS
   - Where is each investing based on open roles?
   - What capabilities are they building?
   - What's the growth trajectory?

This analysis helps me understand where {company_name} is vulnerable or
where they might need help competing more effectively.
```

### When Firecrawl Adds Most Value

| Scenario | Why Firecrawl Helps |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Pre-interview research** | Get deeper context than LinkedIn/Crunchbase alone |
| **Quick win creation** | Analyze their content/messaging to find gaps you can address |
| **Freelance prospecting** | Understand their GTM sophistication before pitching |
| **Competitive positioning** | Know their competitors better than they do |
| **Culture assessment** | Read between the lines on About/Careers pages |
| **Personalization** | Find specific hooks from their content to reference |

### Cost/Credit Optimization

Firecrawl has usage-based pricing. Optimize by:

1. **Prioritize high-value targets** - Only deep-scrape companies you're seriously pursuing
2. **Cache results** - Store scraped data in Clay/Airtable for reuse
3. **Use targeted scraping** - Scrape specific pages, not full site crawls
4. **Batch requests** - Group companies for efficient processing
5. **Start with free tier** - Test patterns before scaling up

```

### CRM Setup for Job Search

Track opportunities like a sales pipeline:

| Stage | Definition | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| **Research** | Identified opportunity, gathering intel | Complete account/contact research |
| **Qualified** | Good fit, have outreach angle | Prepare quick win deliverable |
| **Outreach** | Initial contact made | Monitor response, follow up |
| **Engaged** | Two-way conversation started | Nurture relationship, add value |
| **Interview** | Formal interview process | Prep, perform, follow up |
| **Offer** | Received offer | Evaluate, negotiate |
| **Won** | Accepted position/contract | Celebrate, onboard |
| **Lost** | Rejected or withdrew | Document learnings |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Generic outreach | Shows no research effort | Lead with specific signal/observation |
| Talking about yourself first | They don't care yet | Lead with value for them |
| Asking for coffee chat | Low-value request | Offer specific insight or deliverable |
| Only applying online | Gets lost in ATS | Multi-channel approach with warm paths |
| One and done outreach | Takes 5-7 touches | Systematic follow-up sequence |
| Pitching too early | Feels salesy | Build relationship, then discuss opportunity |

### When Signals Are Weak

If you can't find strong signals:
1. **Expand research** - Check Glassdoor reviews, G2 reviews, Reddit, podcasts
2. **Infer from patterns** - What do similar companies at this stage struggle with?
3. **Ask directly** - Engage in conversation to surface pain points
4. **Create hypothetical** - "Companies like yours often face X - is that relevant?"

### When Response Rate Is Low

Diagnose the problem:
- **Low open rate** → Subject line or timing issue
- **Opens but no reply** → Message not compelling or relevant
- **Initial reply but ghosts** → Follow-up or value proposition issue
- **Lots of "not now"** → Timing or qualifying issue

## Examples

### Good vs. Bad: Outreach Message

**Bad:**
```
Hi Sarah, I'm looking for RevOps roles and saw your posting. I have 5 years
experience in HubSpot and Salesforce. I'd love to chat about the opportunity.
```

**Good:**
```
Hi Sarah, I noticed Acme just closed a Series B and is scaling the sales team
from 5 to 15 reps. That growth usually breaks existing lead routing and
attribution - I've helped 3 similar companies solve this.

I put together a quick territory routing framework based on your ICP.
Worth a look? [link]
```

### Good vs. Bad: Quick Win Deliverable

**Bad:**
- Generic "10 tips for better outbound" PDF
- Resume repackaged as "about me" doc
- Vague strategy recommendations

**Good:**
- Specific workflow diagram for their tech stack
- Rewritten version of their actual cold email
- Lead scoring model based on their ICP
- Integration architecture for their tools

## Summary

The key insight: **Job hunting is outbound sales where you're the product.**

Apply the same GTM principles you'd use for any sales motion:
1. **Research deeply** - Account + contact intelligence
2. **Detect signals** - What are they trying to accomplish?
3. **Lead with value** - Quick wins, not asks
4. **Personalize everything** - Generic = ignored
5. **Follow up systematically** - One touch isn't enough
6. **Track and optimize** - What's working? Iterate.

Your unfair advantage as a GTM professional: **You know how this works.** Use it.
