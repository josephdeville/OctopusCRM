## 🎯 NEXT STEPS - PHASE 1: PRE-QUALIFICATION

For each of the 23 Series A/B companies above, verify:

### Step 1: Employee Count Check (Target: 50-300)
**Method:** LinkedIn company page
- Search: `site:linkedin.com/company/[company-name]`
- Look for employee count on company page

### Step 2: Tech Stack Verification (Need: ZoomInfo OR Apollo OR Clay)
**Methods:**
1. **BuiltWith.com** - Check: `builtwith.com/[domain]`
2. **Job Postings** - Search job descriptions for mentions:
   - "Experience with ZoomInfo required"
   - "Apollo.io experience"
   - "Familiarity with Clay"
3. **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** - Check if company uses enrichment tools

### Step 3: GTM Job Posting Check (Last 90 Days)
**Search Pattern:**
```
site:linkedin.com/jobs [Company] ("Revenue Operations" OR "Sales Operations" OR "Marketing Operations")
```

**Filter:** Date Posted: Last 3 months

### Step 4: Trigger Identification
For companies passing Steps 1-3, find ONE of:
- ✅ **Recent funding** (last 6 months) - Most already have this!
- ✅ **New CRO/VP Sales hire** - LinkedIn: `[Company] AND ("Chief Revenue Officer" OR "VP Sales") AND "Started new position"`
- ✅ **Compliance deadline** - Search: `[Company] AND ("SOC 2" OR "ISO 27001" OR "GDPR")`
- ✅ **Geographic expansion** - Job postings in new regions, press releases
