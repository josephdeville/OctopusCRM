# GTM Job Posting Qualification Workflow
## Find Companies Actively Hiring for GTM Roles (Last 90 Days)

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Companies posting GTM roles in the last 90 days are:
- ✅ **In Active Pain** - Hiring because current team is overwhelmed
- ✅ **Have Budget** - Already approved headcount for $120K+ roles
- ✅ **Receptive to Alternatives** - Open to "build vs. buy" conversation
- ✅ **Time-Sensitive** - Hiring takes 3-6 months; you can start in 2 weeks

**Your Pitch:** "You're trying to hire a $150K VP RevOps who won't start for 6 months. What if you could get that capability next week for $20K/month?"

## 🚀 Quick Search Methods

### **Method 1: LinkedIn Jobs (Fastest - Batch Search)**

**Step 1:** Use LinkedIn Jobs search with this query:
```
("Revenue Operations" OR "RevOps" OR "Salesforce Administrator" OR "Marketing Operations" OR "Sales Operations" OR "GTM" OR "Go-to-Market" OR "Head of Growth")
Date Posted: Past Month
```

**Step 2:** Filter by company using the list below (I'll create this for you)

**Step 3:** Export results to track which companies are hiring

---

### **Method 2: Company Career Pages (More Accurate)**

**Create a batch URL list:**
```
https://[company].com/careers
https://jobs.lever.co/[company]
https://[company].greenhouse.io
https://boards.greenhouse.io/[company]
```

**Check for GTM role keywords:**
- Revenue Operations
- RevOps
- Marketing Operations
- Sales Operations
- Salesforce Admin
- Business Systems
- GTM/Go-to-Market

---

### **Method 3: Google Search (Scalable)**

**Search query format:**
```
site:linkedin.com/jobs [Company Name] ("Revenue Operations" OR "RevOps" OR "Marketing Operations")
```

**Example for Harness:**
```
site:linkedin.com/jobs Harness ("Revenue Operations" OR "RevOps" OR "Marketing Operations" OR "Salesforce")
```

**Pro Tip:** Add `after:2024-10-01` to Google search to filter to last 90 days

## 📋 Tracking Sheet

I'll create a CSV with all 105 companies and columns for you to track:

| Company | LinkedIn Jobs URL | GTM Role Posted? | Role Title | Date Posted | Urgency Score |
|---------|------------------|------------------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| Harness | [auto-generated] | YES/NO | VP RevOps | 2025-01-05 | HIGH |

**Urgency Score:**
- **HIGH** = Posted in last 30 days (hiring is urgent)
- **MEDIUM** = Posted 30-60 days ago (still in process)
- **LOW** = Posted 60-90 days ago (may have filled or paused)

---

## 🎯 Prioritization Logic

### **Tier 1: HOT (Contact Immediately)**
Companies with:
- ✅ RevOps/Marketing Ops/Sales Ops role posted in last 30 days
- ✅ Series B/C funding (have budget)
- ✅ $5-20M ARR range (RevPartners sweet spot)

### **Tier 2: WARM (Contact This Week)**
Companies with:
- ✅ Growth/Demand Gen role posted in last 60 days
- ✅ Any stage with GTM hiring signal
- ✅ Multiple GTM roles posted (scaling signal)

### **Tier 3: QUALIFIED (Standard Outreach)**
Companies with:
- ❌ No recent GTM roles BUT
- ✅ Match ICP (Series B, $5-20M ARR)
- ✅ Recent funding (have budget)

## 📧 Email Template for Companies with Active Job Postings

**Subject:** Saw your VP RevOps posting - have you considered an alternative?

**Body:**
```
[FirstName],

Saw you're hiring for a VP of Revenue Operations - congrats on the growth that's
forcing the hire.

Quick question: Have you considered whether you need a full-time VP, or just the
*capability* while you scale?

Most companies at your stage face:
- 4-6 month hiring cycle for senior RevOps talent
- $150K+ salary + equity + benefits
- Risk of bad hire = another 6 months lost

We work with Series B SaaS companies who need RevOps execution starting next week,
not next quarter. Here's what we provide instead of a hire:

- Start Monday (not month 6)
- $20K/month (not $180K/year)
- Senior team who's done this 40+ times (not learning on your dime)
- Scale up/down as needs change (not locked into headcount)

We just helped [Similar Company] who was hiring for the same role. They paused
the search after seeing what we delivered in Week 1.

Worth 15 minutes to discuss before you make an offer?

Best,
[Your Name]
RevPartners

P.S. - If you've already made an offer, we can still help - most new RevOps VPs
need execution support while they ramp. We become their extended team.

## 🤖 Automated Search (If You Want to Batch This)

I can create a Python script that:
1. Takes the 105 company list
2. Searches LinkedIn Jobs API (if you have access) or scrapes career pages
3. Returns which companies have posted GTM roles in last 90 days
4. Outputs a prioritized list

**Would you like me to build this?**

---

## 📊 Expected Results

From 105 companies, you'll likely find:
- **15-25 companies** (15-25%) with active GTM job postings
- **5-10 companies** (5-10%) with RevOps-specific roles
- **30-40 companies** (30-40%) with general growth hiring (Sales, Marketing, CS)

This gives you:
- **Tier 1 (HOT):** 5-10 companies to contact immediately
- **Tier 2 (WARM):** 15-20 companies to contact this week
- **Tier 3 (QUALIFIED):** Remaining 70-80 for standard outreach cadence

## 🚀 Next Steps

2. **Option B:** I build a Python scraper to batch-check all 105 companies
3. **Option C:** I give you the top 20 companies most likely to have GTM roles posted (based on stage/funding)

**Which option do you prefer?**
