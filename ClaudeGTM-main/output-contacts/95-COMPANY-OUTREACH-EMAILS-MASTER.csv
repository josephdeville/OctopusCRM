**Who's centralizing YOUR revenue data?**

Most analytics companies have blind spots in their own pipeline visibility because they're too close to the product:
- Marketing says they sourced 60% of pipeline
- Sales says it's 20%
- Your CRM can't tell you who's right

AgTech and IoT companies have unique challenges:
- Seasonal sales cycles (planting season ≠ harvest season)
- Regional complexity (Midwest vs. West Coast buying patterns)
- Hardware + SaaS hybrid business model
- Farm budgets tied to crop yields (not quarterly)

Generic CRM doesn't handle seasonal agricultural buying cycles.","At Series A, ""we think spring will be strong"" isn't a forecast—it's seasonal guessing.

Digicust,digicust.com,Seed,$2-5M,Sector - Logistics/Supply Chain,"Who's streamlining YOUR sales process?","[FirstName],

You automate customs declarations with AI for freight forwarders and logistics companies.

But at Seed stage selling B2B to freight forwarders, here's what I see:

**Logistics tech has fragmented, relationship-driven sales that traditional RevOps misses:**
- Deals close via relationships (not product demos)
- Regional partnerships matter more than features
- Long evaluation cycles with operational testing
- Procurement tied to shipping volumes (seasonal)

Your CRM shows ""pipeline"" but doesn't capture the relationship drivers that actually close deals.","At Seed with investors watching, you need to show predictable B2B growth—not just pilot partnerships.

You automate translation and localization workflows for global enterprises.

But at $15-30M ARR, here's the question:

**Are YOUR revenue workflows automated?**

Localization companies selling to global enterprises have pipeline complexity:
- Multi-region deals (EMEA + APAC + Americas)
- Each region has different procurement processes
- Buying cycles don't align across geographies
- Attribution chaos (which region sourced the deal?)

You help enterprises localize content. But can you consolidate global pipeline into a single forecast?","At this scale, your board wants unified pipeline visibility—not regional guesswork.
