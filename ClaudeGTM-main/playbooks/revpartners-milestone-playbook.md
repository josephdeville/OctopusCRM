## 1. ⚙️ Core Strategy: Description & Executive Summary

| Element | Summary |
|---------|---------|
| **Description** | B2B SaaS companies that just raised Series B (typically 5-20M ARR) face a brutal transition: their scrappy, founder-led revenue motion that got them here completely breaks at scale. What worked with 10 deals a month collapses under 50. Their RevOps leader—often their first hire in this function—is drowning in Salesforce admin work, partnership attribution requests, and executive demands for pipeline visibility they can't deliver. |
| **Executive Summary** | Series B companies have 18-24 months to prove they can scale efficiently or face down-round pressure. The revenue operations infrastructure that got them to Series A—spreadsheets, manual processes, part-time Salesforce admins—becomes the bottleneck preventing them from hitting their new growth targets. Most hire a VP of RevOps and expect them to build enterprise-grade systems, but these leaders lack the technical execution capacity to implement what they know needs to happen. |

**The Core Tension**

These companies need to triple their revenue in 24 months while their current RevOps infrastructure can barely support current volume. The new VP of RevOps knows exactly what needs to be built—proper attribution models, partner ecosystem management, automated reporting, clean data architecture—but they're a strategic thinker, not a Salesforce developer. They're stuck choosing between expensive consulting firms that don't understand their business or trying to hire specialized talent in a market where RevOps engineers command $180K+ and take 6 months to find. Meanwhile, the board wants answers next quarter, sales leaders are making decisions on bad data, and partnership revenue is invisible in their reporting.

**Why Conventional Solutions Fail**

Hiring a full-time RevOps team is prohibitively expensive and slow—each specialized role (Salesforce Admin, Analytics Engineer, Integration Specialist) costs $120-180K and takes 3-6 months to hire. By the time you've built the team, you've burned $500K and 9 months. RevOps consulting firms charge $15-30K/month but treat you like a project, not a partner—they don't stay around to iterate as your needs evolve, and knowledge walks out the door when the engagement ends. Offshore contractors are cheap but require constant management and rarely understand the strategic context of B2B SaaS revenue operations. DIY approaches with your existing team mean your strategic RevOps leader spends 80% of their time buried in Salesforce configuration instead of solving attribution and forecasting problems.

**What Survival Demands**

These teams need technical execution capacity that operates as an extension of their revenue operations function—people who can implement the systems their VP of RevOps designs without requiring full-time salaries or 6-month hiring cycles. They need experts who've built these systems dozens of times before, who understand partner attribution isn't just a Salesforce problem but a data architecture challenge, who can translate strategic requirements into working systems in weeks not quarters. Speed matters because every quarter of bad data means missed targets, wrong hiring decisions, and board pressure. This isn't about buying software; it's about acquiring the specialized technical capacity to execute revenue operations strategy.

**The Real Challenge**

The market assumes RevOps is either a technology problem (buy better software) or a headcount problem (hire more people). But for Series B companies, it's a capability timing problem. They need senior-level technical execution right now, not in 6 months after a hiring process. Their VP of RevOps can design the right attribution model, but they can't personally build the Salesforce workflows, write the SQL queries, and configure the integration middleware. The gap isn't strategy or budget—it's the 3-6 month lag between knowing what needs to be built and having the hands to build it, during which they're making million-dollar decisions on broken data.

## 2. 💡 Key Insights

**The Pressure They're Under**

Series B boards expect 3x revenue growth in 24 months with improving unit economics. The CEO promised these metrics in the fundraising deck and now owns them personally. Every board meeting starts with pipeline review, win rates, and CAC payback—all numbers the RevOps team can't accurately report because attribution is broken and partner-sourced deals are invisible in Salesforce. The VP of Sales is making territory decisions based on gut feel because the data is wrong. Marketing is defending budget without proof of pipeline contribution. The company has maybe 4-6 quarters to prove the scaling model works before the next fundraise, and right now, they can't even accurately answer 'which channels are working?' The timeline isn't theoretical—it's the next board meeting, the next QBR, the next hiring plan that depends on knowing which segments actually convert.

**The Capability Gap**

The VP of RevOps they just hired is excellent at strategy—they know they need multi-touch attribution, partner deal registration workflows, automated territory assignment, and executive dashboards. But they're not a Salesforce developer, data engineer, or integration specialist. They can draw the architecture on a whiteboard but can't personally build the custom objects, write the Apex triggers, or configure the Zapier workflows. Their background is strategic operations, not technical implementation. The company can't afford to hire the three specialized roles needed (Salesforce Admin at $140K, Analytics Engineer at $160K, Integration Specialist at $150K), and even if they could, those hires take 4-6 months in this market. Meanwhile, the strategic work that actually needs the VP's brain—designing the attribution model, defining the partner tier structure, building the forecasting methodology—isn't happening because they're stuck trying to figure out why the Salesforce-HubSpot sync keeps breaking.

**Why Current Approaches Fail**

They tried hiring a Salesforce admin contractor for $100/hour, but that person only knows how to configure fields and workflows—not how attribution should work in a B2B SaaS context or how partner ecosystems complicate revenue reporting. They talked to a RevOps consulting firm that quoted $25K/month for 6 months, but the firm wanted to 'assess their entire tech stack first' and the engagement would end right when they needed ongoing iteration. They considered a full-time hire, posted the job, and got 3 applicants in 2 months—none with the specific Salesforce + data + integrations skill combination they need. The CEO suggested 'can't we just use ChatGPT to build this?' not understanding that revenue operations is about business logic and data architecture, not just technical configuration. Every option is either too slow, too expensive, too inexperienced, or doesn't stick around for the ongoing iteration that revenue operations requires.

**What Keeps Them Up at Night**

The VP of RevOps lies awake knowing they're presenting pipeline numbers to the board that they don't actually trust. Partner-sourced deals worth $2M+ in ARR aren't properly attributed, so partnerships looks like it's underperforming when it might be their best channel. Sales comp is based on revenue numbers that don't account for mid-cycle territory changes, meaning they're probably overpaying some reps and underpaying others. The churn analysis the board requested can't be segmented by acquisition channel because historical data is a mess. They're 90 days into the job and haven't delivered a single strategic project because they're buried in Salesforce firefighting. The fear isn't just that they'll miss targets—it's that they'll make wrong decisions that compound, hiring into the wrong segments or killing a channel that's actually working. And they can't admit to the CEO that they don't have the technical skills to implement what they know needs to happen.

**What Sets Successful Teams Apart**

Companies that successfully scale through Series B separate strategic RevOps leadership from technical execution capacity. Their VP of RevOps focuses on designing attribution models, defining data governance, and building forecasting methodologies—the strategic work that requires business context and judgment. The technical implementation—Salesforce configuration, data pipeline engineering, integration management—is handled by specialized execution resources who've built these systems dozens of times before. These winning teams treat RevOps infrastructure like product development: the VP is the product manager who defines requirements, and execution specialists are the engineering team that ships working systems. They move in weeks, not quarters, because they're not learning Salesforce best practices from scratch or debugging integration issues for the first time. They iterate continuously rather than treating each project as a one-time implementation. Most importantly, they free their strategic leader to actually lead strategy instead of becoming an accidental Salesforce admin.

### Approach Angle

**Lead with...**
Open with a diagnosis of the timing problem: 'Most Series B companies we talk to have a VP of RevOps who knows exactly what needs to be built but doesn't have the technical capacity to build it—and can't wait 6 months to hire that capacity.' Then probe: 'How long has your RevOps leader been trying to get partner attribution working?' or 'What strategic projects are on hold because you're stuck in Salesforce firefighting?' Use proof points from similar-stage companies: 'We worked with a Series B company at $8M ARR where their VP of RevOps was spending 30 hours a week in Salesforce instead of building their forecasting model. We gave them back those 30 hours in the first month.'

**Position as...**
Position as 'technical execution capacity on demand' rather than consulting or software. Frame against the alternatives explicitly: 'You could hire three full-time people for $450K+ and 6 months, or you could pay consulting firms $150K for a 6-month project that ends right when you need iteration, or you could keep having your strategic leader do technical work. We're the option where you get senior-level technical execution starting next week, at a fraction of full-time cost, and we stick around as your needs evolve.' Emphasize the speed: 'We've built partner attribution systems 40+ times. You don't want us to learn on your dime—you want us to implement what already works.'

**Address...**
Address the CEO's concern head-on: 'You hired an expensive VP of RevOps and haven't seen the strategic output you expected. That's not a people problem—it's a capacity problem. Your RevOps leader is doing $80/hour work instead of $300/hour work because they don't have execution resources.' Address the CFO's concern: 'You can't afford three full-time specialized hires right now, and you shouldn't—your needs will change as you scale. You need flexible execution capacity that scales up and down.' Address the board's concern: 'You need accurate attribution and forecasting for the next board meeting, not in Q3 after a hiring process.'

**Make it about...**
Make it about unlocking the strategic value of their RevOps investment. They spent $180K+ hiring a VP of RevOps to design systems that drive efficient growth—attribution that shows which channels work, forecasting that enables smart hiring, partner infrastructure that unlocks ecosystem revenue. But that strategic leader is trapped doing technical implementation, which means the company isn't getting the strategic value they paid for. We give them back their strategic leader by handling the technical execution—which means better decisions, faster growth, and efficient scaling. The transformation is from 'our RevOps leader is a bottleneck' to 'our RevOps leader is driving strategy while execution happens in parallel.'

### Cold Call Framework

**Opener:**
Hi {{FirstName}}, this is [Name] with RevPartners. I'm calling because we work with Series B SaaS companies whose RevOps leaders are stuck doing technical execution instead of strategy—wondering if that resonates with your situation? Do you have 2 minutes?

**Pain Probe Questions:**

1. Tell me about your RevOps function—do you have a dedicated leader and what do they spend most of their time on?
2. When you think about partner-sourced revenue or multi-touch attribution, how confident are you in the data your systems are currently giving you?
3. What strategic RevOps projects—like building forecasting models or attribution infrastructure—keep getting pushed back because your team is handling day-to-day firefighting?

**15-Second Value Statement:**
We're specialized technical execution for revenue operations—we handle the Salesforce configuration, data engineering, and integration work so your RevOps leader can focus on strategy instead of being buried in technical implementation. Companies work with us because they can't afford three full-time specialized hires or wait 6 months for those roles, but they need accurate attribution and forecasting for their next board meeting.

**Common Objections:**

- **"Not interested"** → I totally understand—most RevOps leaders don't realize they have a capacity problem until they try to implement something strategic and realize they're personally doing all the technical work. If that changes, we're here.
- **"Already have a solution"** → That's great—are you working with a consulting firm, contractors, or did you hire full-time? Just curious, what happens when that engagement ends or when your needs change? We're designed to be ongoing execution capacity, not a project that ends.
- **"Send me info"** → I can do that, but honestly most people don't really get what we do from an email—it's easier if I just ask you three questions about your RevOps setup and we'll both know in 5 minutes if this is relevant. Do you have 5 minutes now or should we schedule 15 minutes later this week?

**Close:**
Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you've got the strategic leadership but you're missing the technical execution capacity to implement what needs to be built. I'd love to schedule 30 minutes to walk through your specific setup—partner attribution, forecasting infrastructure, whatever's on your roadmap—and show you exactly how we'd approach it. Does [specific day/time] work for a deeper conversation?
