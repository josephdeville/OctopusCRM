When you're creating a new category like AI-powered social engineering defense, GTM gets hard fast. Enterprises don't have budget line items for deepfake training yet. You're not competing on features, you're educating a market that doesn't know this problem exists. If attribution is broken, you can't prove which message actually resonates."

When cybersecurity companies create new categories, the sales challenge isn't closing deals.

Lightspeed doesn't write checks like that lightly.
